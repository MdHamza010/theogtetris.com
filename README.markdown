A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/toni-leigh/pen/oclKj](https://codepen.io/toni-leigh/pen/oclKj).


use the arrow keys to move pieces, space to rotate and 1 to pause the game

the Config object displays the levels with the interval being the number of milliseconds between automatic piece move down and the threshold being the number of intervals that elapse before the level moves up one.

scores are the square of the number of rows removed by piece placement

make sure to click on the board area or the keys wont work :-)
